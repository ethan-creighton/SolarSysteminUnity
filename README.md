A simple version of the Solar Systen in Unity.

The planets all are on an axis, and rotate around the sun around what they do in real life however are way faster (we don't need to way 1000 days to see a change). 
As space is something I'm interested in I wanted to make it really feel like the Solar System sped up, so I did research to get the right axis, spin right, etc.
